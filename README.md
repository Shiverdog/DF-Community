# DF-Community
A community resource pack for the Minecraft server DiamondFire.
Anyone can contribute files as long as they do not conflict with Vanilla minecraft (modifying Vanilla textures, etc.) and other parts of the Community Pack.
Contributions are required to abide by DiamondFire's rules. Do not contribute content that would not be allowed on the server, it will be denied.

Ideally, this will help people download less resource packs for different DiamondFire projects, keeping people's resource packs folder empty.
Contributers are encouraged to update their own contributions as new updates come along.

### Version
DF-Community is currently in Minecraft version 1.17, as that is the version of the DiamondFire's node beta. If you are using 1.16, the resource pack should work fine.
DF-Community's update version is 8.2.21 (MM/DD/YY)
### Wiki
It is recommended to include how to use your contributions in the respository's Wiki page [here](https://github.com/Shiverdog/DF-Community/wiki/).
