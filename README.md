# DF-Community
A community resource pack for the Minecraft server DiamondFire.
Anyone can contribute files as long as they do not conflict with Vanilla minecraft (modifying Vanilla textures, etc.) and other parts of the Community Pack.
Contributions are required to abide by DiamondFire's rules. Do not contribute content that would not be allowed on the server, it will be denied.

Ideally, this will help people download less resource packs for different DiamondFire projects, keeping people's resource packs folder empty.
Another goal this project aims to do is fix issues with compatibility.
In vanilla Minecraft, only one resource pack is allowed to edit an item or block's model.json. Normally this wouldn't be a problem but when dealing with CustomModelData, only the resource pack placed at the top will be allowed to modify the model.json

This means even if two resource packs normally had no compatibility problems (used unique CustomModelData numbers, etc), only one would take effect. By using the same resource pack for multiple projects instead of several different resource packs, all the contributions will at the same time.
Contributers are encouraged to update their own contributions if a newer version breaks theirs.

### Version
DF-Community is currently in Minecraft version 1.17, as that is the version of the DiamondFire's node beta. If you are using 1.16, the resource pack should work fine.
DF-Community's update version is 8.11.21 (MM/DD/YY)
### Wiki
It is recommended to include how to use your contributions in the respository's Wiki page [here](https://github.com/Shiverdog/DF-Community/wiki/).
